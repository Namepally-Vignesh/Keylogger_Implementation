# Simple Keylogger Implementation (For Educational Purposes Only)
## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

Misuse of this code for malicious activities is illegal and unethical. Always obtain explicit consent before monitoring any computer activity.

## Objective
To create a simple keylogger that captures keystrokes and saves them to a local file. This project helps in understanding:
* Input device monitoring.
* File system interaction for logging.
* Basic event-driven programming in Python.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* `pynput` library
  ```bash
    pip install pynput
    ```
* File system access (for writing the log file)

## Usage
1.  **Run the script:**
    Navigate to the directory where `keylogger.py` is saved in your terminal/command prompt and execute:
    ```bash
    python keylogger.py
    ```
    You will see a message indicating the keylogger has started and instructions on how to stop it.
2.  **Test it:**
    Start typing in any application (e.g., a text editor, web browser, etc.). The keystrokes will be silently logged.
3.  **Check the log file:**
    A file named `keylog.txt` will be created in the same directory as the `keylogger.py` script. Open this file to view the recorded keystrokes.
4.  **Stop the keylogger:**
    Press the `Esc` key on your keyboard. The script will detect this and terminate gracefully.

## How it Works
The `keylogger.py` script uses the `pynput` library to listen for keyboard events.
* **`on_press(key)`:** This function is triggered whenever a key is pressed. It attempts to log the character of the key. For special keys (like `Space`, `Enter`, `Shift`), it logs their descriptive name.
* **`on_release(key)`:** This function is triggered when a key is released. It specifically checks for the `Esc` key. If `Esc` is pressed, it signals the listener to stop, ending the keylogger's operation.
* **Logging:** All captured keystrokes are written to `keylog.txt` with a timestamp using Python's built-in `logging` module.

## Further Exploration (Educational)

For those interested in cybersecurity and system security, here are some areas to research based on this basic implementation:

* **Stealth Techniques:** How do real-world malicious keyloggers hide their processes and avoid detection?
* **Persistence Mechanisms:** How can keyloggers be configured to run automatically on system startup?
* **Data Exfiltration:** How might logged data be sent remotely (e.g., via email, FTP, HTTP requests) without the user's knowledge?
* **Countermeasures:** What security measures (antivirus, firewalls, intrusion detection systems) are designed to detect and prevent keyloggers?
* **GUI Development:** Enhance this script with a simple graphical user interface (using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt) for easier control and log viewing.
